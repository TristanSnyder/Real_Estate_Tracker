## 🔧 **Railway Deployment**

### **Required Environment Variables**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
```

### **Optional Variables**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url  # Falls back to SQLite
PORT=8000                       # Default port
```

### **Deployment Steps**
1. **Connect** your GitHub repository to Railway
2. **Set** the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. **Deploy** - should complete in ~5 minutes
4. **Access** your dashboard at the provided URL

## 💰 **Cost Analysis**

### **OpenAI API Costs**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: $0.0015 per 1K tokens (~$0.001 per query)
- **Typical usage**: 100 queries/day = $3/month
- **Heavy usage**: 1000 queries/day = $30/month

### **Railway Hosting**
- **Starter plan**: $5/month
- **Memory**: 512MB (efficient)
- **Build time**: 5 minutes (fast)

### **Total Cost**: $8-35/month vs $50-100/month with HuggingFace
