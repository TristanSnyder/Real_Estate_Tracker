## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. 🎨 Beautiful Dashboard
- **Location**: `index.html` - Modern glassmorphism design
- **Features**: Real-time status, AI chat, market metrics, competitor analysis
- **Access**: Your Railway URL root (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`)

### 2. 🔑 Hugging Face Authentication
- **Code**: Updated in `real_estate_rag_system.py`
- **Required**: Set `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable in Railway

## 🚂 Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Get Your Hugging Face Token
```bash
# Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Create new token with "Read" permissions
# Copy token (starts with hf_)
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. **Railway Dashboard** → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
2. **Select** your repository
3. **Environment Variables** tab → Add:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
   ```

### Step 3: Optional Database
- Add Service → PostgreSQL (auto-configures `DATABASE_URL`)

### Step 4: Access Your App
- Railway provides a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- Dashboard loads automatically at the root URL

## 🔧 If You Encounter Issues

### Option 1: Use Simplified Requirements
Replace `requirements.txt` with `requirements_simple.txt`:
```bash
mv requirements_simple.txt requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Check Status
Visit `/health` endpoint to see system status:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "rag_system": "ready",
  "llm_status": "ready",
  "hf_token_configured": true
}
```

### Option 3: Logs
Check Railway deployment logs for specific errors.
