# Real Estate RAG System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Limited AI Agent Output**
**Problem**: AI responses were too short and not comprehensive enough for real estate analysis.

**Solution**: Increased token limits significantly:
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: 512 → 1,500 tokens
- **GPT-4**: 512 → 2,000 tokens  
- **GPT-4-turbo**: 512 → 2,500 tokens

**Enhanced Prompt Engineering**:
- Updated system prompt to provide "comprehensive, detailed analysis"
- Added instructions for thorough market analysis with bullet points
- Emphasized including ALL relevant data points, trends, and implications
- Structured responses with clear sections and actionable insights

### 2. **URLs Not Leading to Actual Articles**
**Problem**: URLs were generic and redirected to homepages instead of specific articles.

**Solution**: Replaced sample URLs with real, working article URLs:
- **Commercial Observer**: Real NYC office market article
- **Bisnow**: Actual industrial real estate trends piece
- **Realtor.com**: Current housing market outlook article  
- **GreenBiz**: ESG real estate trends article
- **Retail Dive**: Mixed-use development trends article

**Added URL Validation**:
- Implemented `_validate_url()` function for NewsAPI articles
- Checks for invalid patterns (test domains, localhost, etc.)
- Validates URL accessibility with HEAD requests
- Detects homepage redirects and filters them out
- Added `/test-urls` endpoint for URL validation testing

### 3. **Additional Improvements**
- **Enhanced Response Generation**: Updated LLM prompt to generate more comprehensive analyses
- **Better Context Building**: Improved how documents are processed for context
- **URL Testing Endpoint**: Added `/test-urls` endpoint to verify URL accessibility
- **Fallback Document Updates**: Updated fallback documents with real URLs

## Expected Results

**For AI Responses**:
- Much longer, more detailed responses (up to 2,500 tokens)
- Comprehensive market analysis with specific data points
- Structured responses with clear sections
- Actionable insights for real estate professionals

**For URL Issues**:
- Working URLs that lead to actual articles
- Better source attribution with real publication names
- Validation prevents broken or redirected URLs
- Test endpoint to verify URL accessibility

## Testing

1. **Test Response Length**: Query the system with "What are the current commercial real estate trends?" to see comprehensive responses
2. **Test URLs**: Visit `/test-urls` endpoint to verify URL accessibility
3. **Test Source Links**: Click on source URLs in responses to verify they lead to actual articles

## Configuration Notes

- System works with or without OpenAI API key (graceful degradation)
- URLs are validated during NewsAPI integration
- Fallback documents provide working URLs even without NewsAPI
- All improvements maintain backward compatibility
